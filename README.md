# capture-nvim

plugin to quickly store ideas with exact place in a file

## Dependency
Does not work on current stable build (0.4.4). Needs neovim nightly as of now

## Installation
```
Plug 'nagy135/capture-nvim'
```

## Usage
This plugin is in initial development so all we have now is :

+ leader X - create new todo
+ leader J - jump to file (improved gF that jumps to column as well as line)
